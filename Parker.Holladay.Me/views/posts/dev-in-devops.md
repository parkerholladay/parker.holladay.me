The term DevOps has become something of buzz word in the last couple of a years, but what is DevOps really?

## Software Craftsmanship and DevOps

### It's not the tools that give you DevOps

### It's not the team that give you DevOps

I recently saw a slide in a presentation that made me cringe. The following teams were listed. `Platform`, `Architecture`, `DevOps`, and it was insinuated that because a "DevOps" team existed, "we have dev ops." I will not get into the semantics of whether a DevOps team should exist, but I want to highlight that the mere existence of a team called DevOps does mean you "have" DevOps.

Tongue in cheek catch phrase:
> Sprinkle some DevOps on it

## Resist the temptation to poach developers for DevOps
